This package allows for encryption of data using public-private keypairs, it can be extended to a global or per user public private, or even any other combination based on your own keyprovider implementation

## Important

If you're making partial updates to an existing encrypted record, ensure your user has access to the records key. If you not, the library will create a new key for that record for your partial update, and you won't be able to decrypt other encrypted fields that weren't written in that update.

From Laravel's Docs:

`When issuing a mass update via Eloquent, the saved and updated model events will not be fired for the updated models. This is because the models are never actually retrieved when issuing a mass update.`

For this reason we have blocked out the batch insert and mass update methods â€” they will throw an exception. This does not block direct queries, or `DB::insert`, etc, so you can set up mass insert or update using the base DB class if required. Just take care ðŸ˜…

<a name="installation"></a>

## Installation

Install via composer

```bash
composer require custom-d/eloquent-model-encrypt
```

Publish the config & migration & run migration & generate Global Public/Private Keypair

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=eloquent-model-encrypt_config --tag=eloquent-model-encrypt_migration
php artisan migrate
php artisan asynckey
```

You may need to update the timestamp on the migration to run after your User Migration (if needed)

### Register Service Provider

**Note! This and next step are optional if you use laravel>=5.5 with package
auto discovery feature.**

Add service provider to `config/app.php` in `providers` section

```php
CustomD\EloquentModelEncrypt\ServiceProvider::class,
```


---

<a name="upgrade"></a>
## upgrade from V2.x

### Major Changes
- We no longer use a custom column type, so you will need to switch out all your migrations calls to `encryptedString`, `encryptedDate`, `encryptedTimestamp` to a single `encrypted` column type
- Interface required for Encryptable Models `CustomD\EloquentModelEncrypt\Contracts\Encryptable`
- PemStore Facade for your session based PEM Storage -- you will need to upgrade your mappings to use this. `CustomD\EloquentModelEncrypt\Contracts\PemStore`
- `CustomD\EloquentModelEncrypt\Middleware\InitPemStore` middleware added works with the above contract
- Fixed missing typeCasting on the `KeyProvider::getPublicKeysForTable` abstract you will need to update your implementations
---

### Minor Changs
- `::isValueEncrypted` has been removed and replaced with `::isCyphertext` and `::isPlaintext`


<a name="usage"></a>

## Usage

<a name="config"></a>
### Config

The default config contains the following variables:

Variable | Default | Description
---------|---------|------------
engines | Array | [See below documentation](#engines).
tables | [] | Assign different engines for different tables. [See below documentation](#engines).
publickey | storage/_certs/public.key | Can be either a path, or the key contents itself.
privatekey | storage/_certs/private.key | Can be either a path, or the key contents itself.
models | Array | You can extend the models for the different key storage logic.
throw_on_missing_key | false | Have the engine throw a `DecryptException` when trying to decrypt a record without the appropriate key.
pem | [] | holds the class for the PEM store (Cache, Session or Custom class with its settings)
listener | bool | switch on to enable auto-listener for login / logout events along with the PEM above.


<a name="keyproviders"></a>

### Key Providers

By default we ship a single Key Provider (GlobalKeyProvider) which makes use of the public private keypair generated, the private key is encrypted with the appkey.
You can add your own keypair providers by extending the `CustomD\EloquentModelEncrypt\Abstracts\KeyProvider` abstract.

```php
class MyKeyProvider extends KeyProvider {
    public static function getPublicKeysForTable($record, $extra = []): array
    {
        //return array of public keys to encrypt with / enpty array if not needed
        // eg [ rsaKeyID => publicKey]
        //if you want to use a file based key, pass the id as 0.
    }

    public static function getPrivateKeyForRecord(string $table, int $recordId): ?string
    {
        //return the first key that should have permission to decrypt or null if none.
    }
}
```

You will need to implement the logic to determine whether or not it should encrypt or decrypt based on the rules in the above methods.

By default we have:
* **GlobalKeyProvider** - this uses the public/private key specified in the config above.
* **UserKeyProvider** - this is a User Based key provider - will assign to the current user (or via call to Model::getUserKeyProviderIds)
* **RoleKeyProvider & RoleUserKeyProvider** -- this pair allows you to assign keys to a role. -- Example to come.

You will also need to configure your store for the current users decrypted PEM, as the PEM can only be decrypted with the users password, the best time to store this is during the login process.

From V3 we offer a base version that reads either your application cache or session vars (Default):
You can create your own which should implement the `CustomD\EloquentModelEncrypt\Contracts\PemStore` contract and add this to the pem.class section of the config:

By default we have Session which will store in the users session and Cache which stores in the application cache.
These tie in to the provided listener or can be accessed via the PemStore Facade.


`CustomD\EloquentModelEncrypt\Middleware\InitPemStore` middleware works with the aboe contract

<a name="migrations"></a>

### Migrations

for the encrypted columns in your database simpy add:
```php
$table->encrypted('colname');
```

### Models

#### User Model

Your user model should add the
`CustomD\EloquentModelEncrypt\Model\Traits\HasUserKeystore` trait, additionally passwords should be added to the model unencrypted to allow the keystore to make use of them, it will then hash the password.

#### Encrypteble models
To enable encryption on a specific model you will need to add the following middleware and property to define which columns to encrypt

```php
use CustomD\EloquentModelEncrypt\ModelEncryption;
use CustomD\EloquentModelEncrypt\Contracts\Encryptable;

class YourModel extends Model implements Encryptable
{
	use ModelEncryption;

	protected $encryptable = [
        'encrypted_field 1',
        'encrypted_field 2',
    ];
}
```

By default the GlobalKeyProvider is enabled. You can set which keys to encrypt and decrypt with by overwriting the following statc property

```php
protected static $keyProviders = [
        GlobalKeyProvider::class,
        YourKeyProvider::class
    ];
```

If an array is passed, it will get the public keys from each and add the encryption to each one,
for decryption will look for the first key available from there to decrypt for the current application / user / process.

<a name="engines"></a>

### Engines

If for some reason you need a specific model to use a different encryption engine this can be done by adding it to the config file

```php

return [
    'engines' => [
		'default' => \CustomD\EloquentModelEncrypt\EncryptionEngine::class,
		'MyEngine' => PathToYourEngine::class
    ],
    'tables' => [
		'MyCustomTable' => 'MyEngine'
    ],
];

```

Engines are to extend the `CustomD\EloquentModelEncrypt\Abstracts\Engine` Class and should implement the following methods:

-   **`public function encrypt(string $value): ?string`** - holds the encryption logic - value passed is the unencrypted database field value
-   **`public function decrypt(string $value): ?string`** - holds the decryption logic - value passed is the encrypted database field value
-   **`public function assignSynchronousKey([$synchronousKey = null]): void`** - allows you to set the synchronous key for encrytion - this is called when creating or retrieving a record.

<a name="artisan"></a>

### Artisan

The artisan command is usefull if you are wanting to encrypt an existing model. once you have configured your model run the following command:

```php
php artisan eme:encrypt:model "\App\Models\MyModel"
```

This will select all the records from that table and encrypt them.

## Suggested Packages / Recipes

Here are a few packages that extend the usability of the encryption package

### [Hashed Search](https://github.com/customd/hashed-search)
This pacakge works to allow you to do a Blind Index search on your encrypted data, it works by using a one way hash to encrypt the data and does the same to search it.
the hash is configurable and can be set to either a double hash (hash1 ^ hashh2) or a iteration_count.

### [User Security Recovery](https://github.com/customd/user-security-recovery)
This package allows you to setup a secret question / anser or any such pattern to create an encrypted copy of the private key that a user can use to restore should they forget their password.
